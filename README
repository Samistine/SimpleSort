SimpleSort is a simple plugin which allows players to sort the items in their inventories and chests by the item IDs. It was created as a continuation of VeraLapsa's Inventory Sort plugin, and it's the first plugin made by the Flying Lawnmower Development Team (Shadow1013GL, Pyr0Byt3, and pendo324), so let us know if you find any bugs xD

Commands
	/sort [top] - Sorts top part of the player's inventory.
	/sort all - Sorts all of the player's inventory.
	/sort hot - Sorts the player's hotbar.

Permissions
	simplesort.* - Allows the player to sort both chests and their own inventory.
		simplesort.chest - Allows the player to sort chests by hitting them the wand.
		simplesort.inventory - Allows the player to sort their own inventory.
